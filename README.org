#+TITLE: trav - Traveller Character Generation in Clojure
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil

Clojure functions for generating random characters (and eventually
more) for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller_%28role-playing_game%29#Traveller_.281977.2C_GDW.29][Classic Traveller]], a popular '80s-era role playing game
still being used today.

* Why?

- To experiment with using [[https://github.com/eigenhombre/trav/blob/master/src/trav/char.clj#L41][small DSLs]] to represent RPG rules and tables
- To indulge an ancient fascination with
  - simulation
  - science fiction
  - role playing games
- To see what kind of complex behaviors emerge out of the fairly
  detailed rules provided by the game designer
- To tune and refine my [[https://github.com/eigenhombre/namejen][Markov-chain-based Character Name Generator]]
- As a launching point for other game experiments
- Because it's fun!

* Status

** Done
- Characters
  - Name selection
  - Service determination
  - Commissioning, promotion, reinlistment, survival, aging
  - Standard formatting, incl. UPPs

** Ambitions
- Characters
  - Aging damage
  - Skill selection
  - Benefits
  - Equipment/possessions
- Worlds ("Scouts"-based system generation)
- Encounters
- Starships
- Interplanetary and interstellar travel
- Character and ship combat
- ...

* Usage

For now, see the [[https://github.com/eigenhombre/trav/blob/master/src/trav/char.clj][functions and examples]] in the =trav.char= namespace.
