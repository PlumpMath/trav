#+TITLE: trav - Traveller Character Generation in Clojure
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil

Clojure functions for generating random characters (and eventually
more) for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller_%28role-playing_game%29#Traveller_.281977.2C_GDW.29][Classic Traveller]], a popular '80s-era role playing game
(RPG) still being used today.

* Why?

- To experiment with using [[https://github.com/eigenhombre/trav/blob/master/src/trav/tables.clj#L71][small DSLs]] to represent RPG rules and tables
- To indulge an ancient fascination with
  - simulation
  - science fiction
  - role playing games
- To see what kind of complex behaviors emerge out of the fairly
  detailed rules provided by the game designer
- To tune and refine my [[https://github.com/eigenhombre/namejen][Markov-chain-based Character Name Generator]]
- As a launching point for other game experiments
- Because it's fun!

* Status

** Done
- Characters
  - Name selection
  - Service determination
  - Commissioning, promotion, reinlistment
  - Survival/death, aging effects
  - Skill awards
  - Standard formatting, incl. UPPs and skills

** To Do
*** Generation
- Character retirement benefits
- Worlds ("Scouts"-based system generation)
- Starships
*** Simulation ideas
- Monte Carlo questions:
  - What is the average survival rate during character generation?
  - What strategy optimizes this?
  - What is the averge number of credits received during mustering out?
  - Which skills are most common (depends on service duration, survivability, etc.)?
- Character equipment/possessions
- Narrated character histories
- Encounters
- Interplanetary and interstellar travel
- Character and ship combat
- ...

* Getting it

For the moment, you'll need to check out this repo and =lein install=
it.  Eventually it will probably go up on Clojars.

* Contributing

Pull requests welcome, but only for Classic Traveller, please.  I'm
trying to stay within the constraints of the original Little Black
Books for now (Scouts, Mercenary and High Guard OK).

* Usage

See the [[https://github.com/eigenhombre/trav/blob/master/src/trav/char.clj][functions and examples]] in the =trav.char= namespace.  Or, roll
up a few characters on the command line:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

#+END_EXAMPLE

The main method takes an arbitrary integer number of characters to
generate (default 50).

Example from the REPL:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
;; Example - full characters with name, rank, age and UPP:
(->> make-character
     (repeatedly 50)
     (remove (complement :living?))  ;; Remove those killed while serving
     (sort-by :name)
     (map format-name-map)
     vec)
